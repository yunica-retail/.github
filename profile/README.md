# [Hygienic, Affordable, Trustworthy.](https://www.yunica.co.in)

We make web-scale, high-performance, retail software `products` (e.g. `applications`, `platforms`, `APIs`) and `services`
targeting decentralized **digital enterprises** globally. We specialize in Web3.0 based **digital supply chain**  system
integration and distributed intelligence technology capabilities.

## Digital Retail Solution

We are continuously integrating, building, testing, and deploying [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform)
ecosystem solutions to deliver high quality retail software and reliable systems to the clients. Some among these are available
in a cloud __hosted__ model. However, you have the freedom to download and __self-host__ the same in your own data center (i.e.
on-premise or public Cloud). We use multiple `cloud service providers` to host the solution for reliability and availability
reasons. Most of our solutions are cloud-aware, but definitely cloud agnostic.

## Support Services

We do offer multi-channel technical or customer support services related to our software frameworks, platform APIs, products
and/or services to paid subscribers through a [Global Support Centre](https://desk.yunica.co.in). It is accessible on a 24x7
basis to the clients globally. We engage with [Bhojpur Consulting](https://www.bhojpur-consulting.com), our strategic partner,
for L3/L4 support services due to their technology platform underlying our retail solutions.

## Training Services

For easy technology adoption, we also provide __online__ [training](https://show.yunica.co.in) course delivery and managed
through our [Education Services](https://education.yunica.co.in) platform. These paid services are available to clients globally.

## Partnership Program

We engage with `partners` (e.g., consulting, integration, hosting, support) to provide better technology experience and serve
our clients globally. We have setup a `software developer` program to encourage technology builders adopt our platform in their
products or services.
